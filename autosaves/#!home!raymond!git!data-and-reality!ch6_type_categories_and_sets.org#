* Type: a merging of ideas
** Guidelines
One common denominator is the notion of grouping; we assume that things can be
divided in groups, where the groups are expected to satisfy a number of
guidelines:

  1.  The groups correspond to our intuitive ideas of what things are, i.e, their
classification.
  2.  The groups serve as the scopes over which naming conventions apply, i.e
name syntaxes, uniqueness rules apply.
  3.  The groups serve as unique scopes over which validity constraints apply.
  4.  The groups correspond to the domains of relationships.
  5.  Things don't move from one group to another.
  6.  The groups are mutually exclusive (nothing belongs to more than one such
group) - an enormously bad hangover from the record type heritage, but still
required in almost all definitions

In any discussion of type, it would be useful to establish which of these
guidelines were to be assumed.

** Conflicts
Unfortunately, these guidelines are generally quite incompatible.

* Extended Concepts
** Arbitrary sets
